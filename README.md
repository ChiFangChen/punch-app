## Code design

Every component will have at least 2 files in its folder, which are `index.ts` and `[componentName].tsx`. If there are some styled components relevant to it, there will be 1 more file called `styles.ts` to define some styled components in it.

All common components are placed in the `components` folder. If a component that only the parent use, it will be placed in the parent's folder.

Use redux to manage the data, all the code of data flow is in the modal folder.

Standard functions and variables are defined in the `utils` folder.
